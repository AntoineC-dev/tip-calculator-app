## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [SolidJs](https://www.solidjs.com/)
- [Postcss](https://postcss.org/)

### What I learned

#### SolidJs

I wanted to try solidjs for a while.

It has a react-like syntax but does not work the same way at all. There is no re-render of the all component when state updated and it got me multiple times üòâ.

For exemple I spent hours trynna understand why the values would not update in my Input component and I realized that I was destructuring the props where I should use the built-in [splitProps](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest/api#splitprops) helper.

This is one of the small gotcha that you can encounter in solidjs due to being used to the virtual-dom style of reactivity but overall I love the framework and I will probably use it for my next project üòä

#### CSS Modules vs Inline CSS (Astro/Svelte/etc...) - Ways to use scoped styles

For scoped-styles you can use CSS Modules which I like a bit more than the scoped inline-styles in Svelte or Atro. I like the separation of concerns and the readability as well as the ability to have both the jsx and the css visible at the same time by splitting the editor.

#### Postcss Preset Env - Postcss plugin

I used this awesome postcss plugin again and added more usefull custom selectors:

```css
@custom-media --screen-mobile-only (width < 544px);
@custom-media --screen-tablet (width >= 544px);
@custom-media --screen-tablet-only (544px <= width < 1024px);
@custom-media --screen-desktop (width >= 1024px);

@custom-selector :--heading h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6;
@custom-selector :--text p, span, blockquote;
@custom-selector :--media img, picture, video, canvas, svg;
@custom-selector :--interactive input, button, textarea, select, a;
@custom-selector :--list ul, ol;
```

My postcss config stayed pretty much the same since the Astro project but I had to install `caniuse-lite` as a dev-dependency bacause it would break my build step.

```js
const postcssPresetEnv = require('postcss-preset-env');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    postcssPresetEnv({
      stage: false, // Makes features opt-in instead of opt-out (default)
      features: {
        'custom-media-queries': true,
        'media-query-ranges': true,
        'custom-selectors': true,
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```
